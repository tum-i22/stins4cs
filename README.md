# stins4cs
## A State Inspection Tool for C# programs
This code base contains two C# projects. Developed and tested using visual studio 2015 community/ professional editions. The two tools can be run in visual studio, or they can be used by the executable resulting from compiling the code. We donâ€™t distribute the executables. The tools are configured by a settings file (/Properties/Settings.settings). These settings can be edited in file editor as an XML file, or in visual studio (right click the project->properties->Settings).

##PatternMatching:

This is a tool that helps in finding regex matches in source code. To use this tool, build the code in visual studio after editing the settings. The settings of the tool are as follows:
- Code_path: the absolute path to the input code. Example: C:\Users\user\Documents\TestProject
- Regex: the syntax of the regular expression to check. Example: if\s*\(((?!\s*\{).+)\)\s*\{?(.|\s)*?\}?
- Result_path: the path where to output the result of matching (report text file generated). Example:               C:\Users\user\results\
- Sample_name: the name of the test to be written in the report, this is useful when running multiple experiments. Example: sample-regex1-obfuscated.

##Transformer

This is code for stins4cs. This code performs the sequential process presented in the paper[]. To use this tool, build the code in visual studio after editing the settings. Make sure you have all Roslyn libs  (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) in the build path. The version that we tested Roslyn with is 1.0.0-rc2. The settings of the tool are as follows:
- Path_To_Solution: the absolute path to the input solution file (.sln)  of the input code base. This base will be transformed by the tool. Example: C:\pexsamplestest\Samples.Pex.sln
- Project_Name: the name of the project to be transformed. 
- Output_Dir: the path where to output the transformed code. Example: C:\pexsamplestest-2\
- Pex_Report_Path: the path to the Pex report corresponding to the input code base.  Please refer to Pex documentation for the commands to run and generate the reports. Example:   D:\reports\pexsamples\report.per
- Other settings are for the configuration of the transformation, they have default values. For details about them refer to the paper[].
